# Micrograd Tutorial

In this repository I follow along Andrej Karpathy's Micrograd Video from here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0>

The source code for micrograd can be found here:

It is great to see how to implement the basics of neural network optimization with a similar API as Pytorch in pure Python code in just roughly 150 lines of code.
